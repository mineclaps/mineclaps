# Welcome

Welcome to the Mineclaps Center for Change.  
Here you can suggest new features, request for existing features to be modified, and report mishaps (bugs) that actively impact gameplay.  

## How do i know if my card has been seen?

You can't know for certain, but cards are checked often and once your card has been read and verified, you will receive a response.

## What template do i use?

Use the template that best suits your thought.
For example: If it's a typo, report it as a bug.
But, if it's another word altogether that should be used? put it in as a suggestion.
