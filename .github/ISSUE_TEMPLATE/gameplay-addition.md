### Server of origin
<!-- What server would your feature be added to? Survival? Skyblock? Global? -->
Survival

### Rundown

A command that can be executed with /boom.
The general idea is that it should blow everything up!


### How would this benefit players?

It allows players to sing the national anthem:
"BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM, I WANT YOU IN MY ROOM!"
Also, everybody loves explosions, and raymond.


### How would the community react if it were added?

I expect everybody to be very, very happy if this was added.
